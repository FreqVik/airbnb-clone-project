# Overview of the AirBnB Clone
## Objective

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

## Team Roles
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## Technology Stack
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Feature Breakdown

1. User Management
Handles authentication and authorization for guests and hosts. Users can register, log in, manage their profiles, and switch roles as needed, ensuring personalized access and security across the platform.

2. Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes detailed descriptions, pricing, photos, and availability, giving guests all the information needed to make booking decisions.

3. Booking System
Allows guests to book properties for specific dates, with real-time availability checks. This system ensures accurate pricing calculations and prevents double bookings.

4. Review & Rating System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they’ve stayed at. This builds trust and transparency between users, helping future guests make informed decisions.

5. Photo Upload & Management
Hosts can upload multiple images per listing and designate a cover photo. High-quality visuals enhance the appeal of listings and improve guest engagement.

6. Payment Processing
Integrates a mock or real payment gateway to handle booking transactions. It ensures bookings are confirmed only after successful payment, maintaining financial integrity.

7. Search & Filtering (Optional Advanced Feature)
Users can search for listings by location, price range, guest capacity, and more. This improves discoverability and user experience across the platform.

## API Security
1. Authentication (JWT Tokens)
The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate users. Each user must log in to receive a secure token, which is then required for accessing protected endpoints. This ensures that only verified users can perform actions like bookings or managing listings.

2. Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced to distinguish between guests, hosts, and admins. For example, only hosts can create or modify listings, while only guests can make bookings or leave reviews.

3. Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is applied to prevent abuse of the API, such as brute-force login attempts or spamming endpoints. Requests exceeding a defined threshold (e.g., 100 requests per minute) are temporarily blocked.

4. Data Validation and Sanitization
All incoming data is validated and sanitized at the API level to prevent injection attacks, malformed data, or unexpected behavior.

5. Secure Payment Handling
If integrated with a real payment provider (e.g., Stripe), sensitive data is never stored directly in the app. All transactions occur through secure, PCI-compliant gateways.

## CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code. CI ensures that every code change is automatically tested and integrated into the main branch without breaking existing functionality. CD automates the release process, allowing reliable and consistent deployments with minimal manual intervention.

### Tools Used:
GitHub Actions – Automates workflows for testing, linting, and deploying the application whenever code is pushed or merged.

Docker – Packages the application into containers for consistent deployment across different environments.

Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry – Stores Docker images to be pulled during deployment.

Render / Heroku / Railway / AWS EC2 – Cloud platforms where the backend and frontend can be deployed.

PostgreSQL / MySQL (Cloud-hosted) – For managing production databases.

Optional enhancements include:
pytest or unittest for automated testing
Black + isort for code formatting checks
Pre-commit hooks for local linting before pushing code
